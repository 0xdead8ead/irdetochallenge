 * (// is for C++ comments)
 */
char quote = 'http://google.com';
/*
 * Comments start with /* and end with the opposite
 * (// is for C++ comments)
 */

Example C++ comment:
// C++ style comment
// Another comment, can only be one line, unless terminated by \
as in this case
const char* url = "http://www.irdeto.com";
char * nonConstString = "http://google.com";
char * fillerspace = "file:///catpicture.jpg";

// Another Comment Test Case \
this is also a comment \
so is this

char quote = '\'';
char quote = 'http://google.com';

char quote = 'http://google.com /*hello*/';
